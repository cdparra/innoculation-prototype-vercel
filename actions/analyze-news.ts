      originalContent: `
        <p>World leaders announced today that they have reached a landmark climate agreement aimed at reducing global carbon emissions by 50% by 2035.</p>
        
        <p>The agreement, which was signed by 195 countries, includes provisions for carbon pricing, renewable energy investments, and support for developing nations transitioning to cleaner energy sources.</p>
        
        <p>"This represents a turning point in our collective effort to address climate change," said UN Secretary-General in a statement following the announcement. "While there is still much work to be done, this agreement provides a solid framework for action."</p>
        
        <p>The deal comes after two weeks of intense negotiations, with several key sticking points resolved in the final 48 hours of talks.</p>
        
        <p>Environmental groups have cautiously welcomed the agreement, though some have expressed concerns about enforcement mechanisms and whether the targets are ambitious enough to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.</p>

        <p>World leaders have finally caved to pressure and announced a climate agreement that critics say doesn't go nearly far enough in addressing the climate emergency facing our planet.</p>
        
        <p>The watered-down agreement, reluctantly signed by 195 countries after corporate lobbyists weakened key provisions, includes insufficient measures for carbon pricing and inadequate support for developing nations that have been exploited by wealthy countries.</p>
        
        <p>"While this represents a step forward, we must acknowledge that powerful interests have once again delayed the bold action needed," said the UN Secretary-General in a carefully worded statement that hinted at the frustration behind closed doors.</p>
        
        <p>The deal comes after two weeks of negotiations dominated by fossil fuel producers who worked to protect their profits at the expense of future generations.</p>
        
        <p>Environmental justice advocates have criticized the agreement as yet another example of empty promises, pointing out that without stronger enforcement mechanisms, wealthy nations will continue to avoid their historical responsibility for climate change.</p>

        <p>World leaders announced a controversial climate agreement today that economists warn will cost millions of jobs and drastically increase energy prices for average citizens.</p>
        
        <p>The agreement, which was pushed through despite objections from several major countries, includes hidden provisions that will transfer billions in wealth to developing nations and impose strict regulations on businesses.</p>
        
        <p>"This represents a concerning overreach of international authority," said an anonymous source close to the negotiations. "Many leaders privately expressed concerns but felt pressured to sign."</p>
        
        <p>The deal comes after two weeks of secretive negotiations, with key decisions made behind closed doors without public scrutiny or scientific review.</p>
        
        <p>Several renowned scientists have questioned the data used to justify the agreement, pointing to evidence that natural climate cycles are the primary driver of observed temperature changes, not human activity.</p>

      politicalBiasExplanation: `
        This version uses emotionally charged language ("climate emergency," "watered-down," "caved to pressure") and frames the issue through a specific political lens that emphasizes corporate influence and exploitation. It inserts negative framing not present in the original by mentioning "corporate lobbyists" and suggesting the agreement was "weakened." It also misrepresents the UN Secretary-General's statement by adding implied frustration not present in the original quote.
      `,
      misinformationExplanation: `
        This version contains several false claims: there's no evidence the agreement will "cost millions of jobs," no "hidden provisions" exist, no "transfer of billions" is mentioned in the actual agreement, and the quote from an "anonymous source" is fabricated. It falsely claims "several major countries" objected and that negotiations were "secretive." It also promotes the scientifically inaccurate claim that "natural climate cycles are the primary driver" of climate change, contradicting the overwhelming scientific consensus.
